# Google-Scholar-Results-Fetcher
This script fetches and processes Google Scholar search results using the SerpAPI and saves them to an Excel file. The results are fetched based on a user-provided query, and the number of results to fetch can also be specified by the user. The script ensures a respectful delay between API calls to avoid hitting rate limits.
